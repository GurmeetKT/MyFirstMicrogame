//Project Title: "My First Microgame" 

//Description: My game is a shooter game, and you're supposed to shoot two robots and then you win the game. I customized the game, by making more places to hide from the big robot. 

//Setup Instructions: You would press play again or play. 

//Reflection I learned that it's not that hard to create a game, some challenges were that I had a hard time finding some of the files or packages I had to drag in, but then I found them. Overall though it worked pretty well, now you have more places to hide from the big robot and can shoot at it easily.
